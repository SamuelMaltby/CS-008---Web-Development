        <p class="first">
            Frequency Music Co. is an online magazine focused on highlighting
            and reviewing popular music. Based in Burlington, VT, Frequency tailors
            a website for the younger music fan in the area. Reviews are an integral
            part of the website, written not only by the creators and other resources,
            but also submitted by viewers. The website also features ‘The Collection’,
            a vast array of albums of many different artists and genres created to
            give readers some interests in music they do not regularly listen to.
            The collection is meant to replicate the experience of walking into a
            record shop and browsing the racks of vinyl records. Readers can view
            the Frequency top chart as well as the real-time Billboard top charts
            on the ‘New Releases’ page. Our reviews do not only include new music,
            we have reviews for the classics as well. We have teamed up with our
            colleagues at RollingStone and Pitchfork to help with the older hits.

        <h3 class="h">We focus on three major genres: Rock, Hip-Hop, Pop, and Folk</h3>
        <p class="first"><strong>Rock music</strong> originated in the 1950’s with many different styles emerging.
            Rock music has gone through various transformations throughout time.
            The “classic rock” period starting in the late 60s is the most distinct
            period of rock music to hit radios. </p>
        <p class="first"><strong>Hip-hop</strong> music developed in the 1970s in urban areas of the United States.
            Featuring rhythmic beats and intricate rhyming patterns hip-hop created
            a new culture in the world of music that has been replicated endlessly. </p>
        <p class="first"><strong>Pop music</strong> is often an everchanging genre of music. Originating in the 1950s,
            pop music, short for popular music, was described as music that would often
            be played on radios. Pop music is made up of many diverse styles from rock
            to electronic. Featuring catchy vocals and upbeat tracks, there is a pop song for everyone. </p>
        <p class="first"><strong>Folk music</strong> has been around for hundreds of years but has gone through many
            revivals and changes. Folk music is often composed using acoustic
            instruments all in one room, giving the track a live and open sound. </p>
