            <h2><em>Mothership</em> - Led Zeppelin</h2>
            <h4 class="credit">-- Pitchfork Scores it <span class="score">7/10</span></h4>
            <h3>Essentially a primer for those who actually might not be familiar with the Led Zeppelin catalog,
                this is a collection of unimpeachable songs in search of an audience.</h3>
            <p class="first">Led Zeppelin were never much of a singles band: From 1969 on, guitarist Jimmy
                Page was adamant that the group's LPs not be mucked up with filler, so most of
                their releases contain only between eight and 10 tracks. Led Zeppelin's legacy
                so significantly shaped the next four decades of rock'n'roll and heavy metal
                that to further discount any one of those tracks seemed brash, negligent, or stupid.
                Twelve years of intense self-editing meant that Led Zeppelin required no best-of.
                Anyone truly interested in their music was advised to dig through their couch cushions
                until they came up with enough quarters to invest in one (or all) of the band's albums:
                It would be worth every penny.</p>

            <p class="first"><em>Mothership</em>-- a collection of 24 of Led Zeppelin's "greatest hits," remastered
                and selected by the band's three remaining members (Page, as well as Robert Plant
                and John Paul Jones)-- might be conceptually flawed, but it's hard to argue against
                songs as indisputably great as these. <em>Mothership</em> is not the first time Page has participated
                in the distillation of his own work: In 1990, a decade after John Bonham downed his last shot
                of vodka, Page curated an eponymous boxset (known, in fan parlance, as Crop Circles) which saw
                their eight-album discography distilled to four perfect CDs. And in 2002, Atlantic released Early
                Days and Latter Days: Volumes 1 and 2 (each previously available as a single purchase, in 1999 and
                2000, respectively), a Page-condoned collection of 23 tracks which awesomely featured all four members
                of Led Zeppelin on the cover, dressed in giant American space suits and perched casually in front of an
                illustrated moonscape. Early Days and Latter Days has a tracklist similar to <em>Mothership</em> (the latter
                adds "D'yer Mak'er", "Over the Hills and Far Away", "Heartbreaker", and "Ramble On", but loses
                "Ten Years Gone", "What Is and What Should Never Be", and "The Battle of Evermore") so, clearly,
                the idea of Led Zeppelin's greatest hits is contentious even for the band itself.

            <p class="first">Fans will probably argue over Led Zeppelin's selections-- omitting "What Is and What Should Never Be"
                feels unforgivable-- and it seems obvious that Page, Plant, and Jones were striving hard to represent
                every last phase of their career: Some work from the band's crucial 1969-1975 era is sacrificed for
                late-career tokens like the comparably-mediocre "In The Evening" (itself a curious selection, given
                the relative popularity of In Through the Out Door's "Fool in the Rain", which was the band's last
                release to make the pop single charts). Still, content-critiquing aside, the remastering on <em>Mothership</em>
                is no small achievement, and it sounds revelatory on even the shittiest stereos. Check Bonham's
                pitter-pattering in the verses of "Ramble On", or the still-intact fuzz at the top of "Immigrant Song",
                or the tiny percussive "fwwpts" on "D'yer Mak'er", or the restored outro to "Over the Hills and Far Away".
                Twist your volume knob heavenward and embrace Plant's inescapable geekiness, yelping about Gollum and Mordor;
                chug booze and air-drum with John Bonham: Led Zeppelin sound as tremendous in 2007 as they did in 1972.

            <p class="first"><em>Mothership</em> offers no bonus content or previously unreleased material. It serves, mainly, as an
                introduction for those (presumably out of classic rock radio range) still unfamiliar with the band.
                Longtime fans will find little of use here, although anyone who spends a couple hours with <em>Mothership</em>
                will find themselves duly reminded that Led Zeppelin are quite possibly the finest rock band of all time.

            <h2><em>KOD</em> - J. Cole</h2>
            <h4 class="credit">-- Pitchfork Scores it <span class="score">6.3/10</span></h4>
            <h3>With his fifth album, the North Carolina rapper aims for
                righteousness but often ends up sounding self-righteous instead.</h3>
            <p class="first">Listening to a J. Cole album can feel like listening to
                a very intense young lawyer attempt to win a difficult case. Throughout
                his career, Cole’s raps have often been self-serious and polemical, with
                their success depending on the overall strength of his argumentation above
                all else. And while many of his individual claims can be convincing, you
                often get to the end of a song and think something like: Wait, did he really
                just argue that corporations take taxes and use them to buy and spread guns?
                Few artists stake so much on their ability to persuade an audience of their
                worldview, particularly when that worldview is so absolutist. You do not listen
                to J. Cole to enjoy his wit or his stories, but to partake in his wisdom, which
                often involves an element of moral panic: On his new addiction-themed album, KOD,
                he loves to suggest that people should abstain from things—smoking, drinking, online
                dating. Sometimes, he’s persuasive, but just as often, he simply seems self-righteous.</p>

            <p class="first">For a talented technical rapper with reverence for hip-hop’s history,
                Cole has never really been playful. (His previous album, 4 Your Eyez Only, was
                all about death.) Aside from his weakness for corny punchlines, his verses are
                frequently free of the word games that his top-tier peers revel in. But even so,
                Cole is capable of making a strong case for his beliefs. When he does, it’s thanks
                to the emotional appeals he embeds in certain songs. On “FRIENDS,” he confesses to
                his dependence on weed before calling out specific friends who abuse drugs; in asking
                them to stop, he mostly ditches his sanctimony. On another standout, “Kevin’s Heart,”
                Cole uses the pint-sized comedian’s very public infidelities to reflect on the challenge
                of monogamy: “My phone be blowing up/Temptations on my line/I stare at the screen a
                while before I press decline.” Cole is most effective when he keeps things personal
                rather than turning up his nose at the choices of others.</p>

            <p class="first">Other songs work because of the North Carolina rapper’s
                technical ability and skill behind the boards. Previously, when Cole
                has wanted to make a statement, he’s asked all collaborators to leave
                the room. The new album, like his would-be magnum opus, 2014 Forest Hills
                Drive, is absent of other artists (save kiLL edward, a mysterious guest whose
                voice, when sped up, sounds like J. Cole’s), and Cole produced much of it
                himself. “ATM” and the title track are potent reminders of the way he can
                rip up a song with his flow alone. Cole is friends with Kendrick Lamar,
                and KOD, with its stripped-down production, snare-drum flows, and focus on
                virtue and vice, can feel like a pale shadow of DAMN. Unlike the Pulitzer
                winner, Cole is far more predictable and accessible.</p>

            <p class="first">Cole simplifies lust on “Photograph,” where he again reminds
                us that his ideal woman is a holy Madonna who is sexy but never shows too
                much skin. He’s thoughtlessly proud on “The Cut Off,” in which he commends
                himself for his generosity after talking about how tempted he is to become
                violent. And on “BRACKETS,” he boils down a complicated topic in order to
                make a difficult argument work. The song ends with the story of a mother who
                loses her son. On the day of her son’s funeral, she remembers she has to pay
                her taxes, which she believes indirectly funded his death. Much like DAMN., the
                song uses the cyclical nature of time to make a point—that taxes are evil. But
                unlike Kendrick, Cole jury-rigs the narrative to make his case. Specious as they
                may be, songs like “BRACKETS” help us understand Cole’s appeal: He unites his
                audience against bogeymen like taxes, or the government, or white teachers in
                black schools, or a new generation of rappers. If you agree that those things
                are unequivocally Bad, you might be willing to listen when he tells you what not to do.</p>

            <p class="first">The most personal song on KOD is about his mother, Kay,
                and it combines the emotional appeal and evocative detail of the album’s
                best tracks with the selfishness of its worst. On “Once an Addict (Interlude),”
                Cole recalls his mom drinking too much after his stepfather had a child by
                another woman—even pinpointing the Marvin Gaye and Al Green songs she was
                listening to at the time—as he regrets his own callous reaction (“Why she
                always using me for a crutch?”). But while those elements make the song powerful,
                Cole expresses a surprising lack of empathy for his mother’s troubles, even with
                the benefit of hindsight, and is hamstrung by clumsy lines (“Maybe things get better
                with time, I heard it heals”). Listeners are asked to think about the rapper’s pain,
                rather than his mother’s.</p>

            <p class="first">Kay has encouraged her younger son to use her struggles
                as a warning to others, which he has done in the past. But there’s more
                to her story. She worked hard raising two sons by herself, working as a
                mail carrier to the point where her feet ached. One of those sons became a
                successful rapper, bought her a house, granted her the opportunity to stop
                carrying mail and to pursue acting, to meet Barack Obama and Afeni Shakur.
                In its haste to show the ugliness of her addiction KOD’s portrait of her
                glosses over any and all explanatory or redemptive details. It misses many
                other things too, when it conflates healthy and abusive self-medication, or
                refuses to make a distinction between marijuana, alcohol, and harder drugs.
                Because Cole is so often trying to convince us, he frequently only tells one
                side of the story, concealing the full picture in order to win an argument
                that nobody started.</p>

            <h2><em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> - Kanye West</h2>
            <h4 class="credit">-- Pitchfork Scores it <span class="score">10/10</span></h4>
            <h3>Kanye's big year culminates in an LP that feels
                like an instant greatest hits, the ultimate realization
                of his strongest talents and divisive public persona.</h3>
            <p class="first">Kanye West's 35-minute super-video, Runaway, peaks with a parade.
                Fireworks flash while red hoods march through a field. At the center of the
                spectacle is a huge, pale, cartoonish rendering of Michael Jackson's head.
                My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy's gargantuan "All of the Lights" soundtracks
                the procession, with Kanye pleading, "Something wrong, I hold my head/ MJ gone,
                our nigga dead." The tribute marks another chapter in West's ongoing obsession
                with the King of Pop.</p>

            <p class="first">West's discography contains innumerable references and allusions
                to Jackson. His first hit as a producer, Jay-Z's "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)", sampled the
                Jackson 5's "I Want You Back". For many, his first memorable lines as a rapper
                came during 2003's "Slow Jamz": "She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael
                Jackson/ Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson." And when West's
                recent interview with Matt Lauer on the "Today" show went awry, he took to Twitter,
                writing, "I wish Michael Jackson had twitter!!!!!! Maybe Mike could have explained
                how the media tried to set him up!!! It's all a fucking set up!!!!" Like most everything
                else, Kanye may exaggerate the kinship, but it's real. And it's never more apparent than
                on Twisted Fantasy, a blast of surreal pop excess that few artists are capable of
                creating, or even willing to attempt.</p>

            <p class="first">To be clear, Kanye West is not Michael Jackson. As he told MTV last
                month, "I do have a goal in this lifetime to be the greatest artist of all time,
                [but] that's very difficult being that I can't dance or sing." He ended the thought
                with a laugh, but you get the impression he's not kidding. Unlike Michael, he's not
                interested in scrubbing away bits of himself-- his blackness, his candidness-- to
                appease the masses. And while Jackson's own twisted fantasies of paranoia and betrayal
                eventually consumed him whole, West is still aware of his illusions, though that
                mindfulness becomes increasingly unmoored with each newspaper-splashing controversy.
                The balance is tenuous, but right now it's working to his advantage. On Twisted
                Fantasy, Kanye is crazy enough to truly believe he's the greatest out there. And,
                about a decade into his career, the hardworking perfectionist has gained the talent
                on the mic and in the control room to make a startlingly strong case for just that.</p>

            <p class="first">Kanye's last album, 2008's 808s and Heartbreak, was heavy on the
                Auto-Tune and stark synths, but relatively light on grandiose ideas. It was a
                necessary detour that expanded his emotional palette; a bloodletting after a
                harsh breakup and the passing of his mother that manifests itself in Twisted
                Fantasy's harshest lows. But musically, the new album largely continues where
                2007's Graduation left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of The
                College Dropout's comfort-food sampling and Late Registration's baroque
                instrumentation weaved in seamlessly. As a result, the record comes off like a
                culmination and an instant greatest hits, the ultimate realization of his strongest
                talents and divisive public persona. And since the nerd-superstar rap archetype he
                popularized has now become commonplace, he leaves it in the dust, taking his style
                and drama to previously uncharted locales, far away from typical civilization.</p>

            <p class="first">He's got a lot on his mind, too. After exiling himself for months
                following last year's infamous Taylor Swift stage bomb, the rapper made some of
                his first comeback appearances at the headquarters of Facebook and Twitter in late
                July. Videos of West standing on a table in tailored GQ duds while gesticulating
                through new rhymes (sans musical accompaniment) quickly made the rounds. The Silicon
                Valley visits seemed like a stunt, but they were prophetic. Forever an over-sharer,
                Kanye was looking for an outlet for his latest mirror-born musings. He found that
                platform with Twitter, and proceeded to dictate his own narrative in 140 character
                hits. Whether showing off exotic purchases, defending himself against the press, or
                going on stream-of-consciousness rants, Kanye finally had the middleman-free,
                instant-gratification platform he'd always wanted.</p>

            <p class="first">Juiced on the direct connection, he began releasing weekly songs for
                free online, the generosity of which would be moot if the songs didn't deliver.
                But they did, over and over, eventually building up the same type of superstar
                goodwill Radiohead pulled off with their pay-what-you-want In Rainbows release
                plan and Lil Wayne's free mixtape barrage leading up to 2008's Tha Carter III.
                So while Kanye can't sing or dance like Michael, he's making meaningful connections
                in a fresh, oftentimes (ahem) naked way. "When I used to finish an album I would be
                so excited for my mom to hear the final - final!" he wrote on November 11. "The
                final - final is what we used to call the... completed album with all the skits!!!
                I made songs to please one person... MY MOM!!! I would think... would my my Mom like this song!"</p>

            <p class="first">I'm not sure which song he's talking about. Because, between July and
                November, West seemingly decided to make My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy less
                mom-friendly and more of a hedonistic exploration into a rich and famous American
                id. At Facebook, he rapped the first verse of what would become album closer "Lost
                in the World", at one point changing Michael Jackson's "Wanna Be Startin' Something"
                refrain to, "Mama-say mama-sah Mama Donda's son," referring to his late mother. The
                familial allusion was left off the album. Another Facebook tune-- a brutally oedipal
                account called "Mama's Boyfriend"-- was also deleted, along with the
                vintage-Kanye-sounding "See Me Now". Such exclusions speak to the album's sharp
                focus-- to move everything forward while constantly tipping on the brink of frantic instability.</p>

            <p class="first">This isn't the same resourceful prodigy who made The College Dropout or even the
                wounded soul behind 808s and Heartbreak. Instead, Kanye's Twisted Fantasy incarnation cherry-picks
                little things from his previous work and blows them up into something less than sane. The expansive,
                all-encompassing nature of the album is borne out in its staggering guest list which includes mentors
                Jay-Z, RZA, and No ID, along with new charges like Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, and Bon Iver's
                Justin Vernon. The inclusion of Minaj (who contributes the schizoid verse of her life on "Monster"),
                Ross (a guy known for making up his own reality as he goes), and Cudi (who's probably even more wildly
                self-destructive than Kanye) especially adds to the hallucinatory tone. By the time Chris Rock shows
                up to provide comic relief during one of the album's bleakest moments, it begins to feel as if Kanye
                is stage-managing his own award show with enough starpower, shock, and dynamism to flatten the Grammys,
                the VMAs, and the rest all at once.</p>

            <p class="first">Over the past few months, Kanye has intermittently tried to flush away his rep as a
                boorish egoist in interviews and on Twitter, which is, fortunately, impossible. Because without his
                exploding self-worth-- itself a cyclical reaction to the self-doubt so much of his music explores--
                there would be no Twisted Fantasy. "Every superhero needs his theme music," he says on "POWER", and
                though he's far from the virtuous paragons of comic book lore, he's no less complex. In his public
                life, he exhibits vulnerability and invincibility in equal measure, but he's just as apt at
                villainy-- especially here.</p>

            <p class="first">With "Runaway", he rousingly highlights his own douchebaggery, turning it into a
                rallying cry for all humanity. Like many of his greatest songs, it's funny, sad, and perversely
                relatable. And while the royal horns and martial drums of "All of the Lights" make it sound like
                the ideal outlet for the most over-the-top boasts imaginable, West instead inhabits the role of an
                abusive deadbeat desperate to make good on a million blown promises. "Hell of a Life" attempts to
                bend its central credo-- "no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need"-- into a noble
                pursuit. As a woofer-mulching synth line lurks, Kanye justifies his dreams of not sleeping with
                but marrying a porn star, peaking with the combative taunt, "How can you say they live they
                life wrong/ When you never fuck with the lights on." Inspired by his two-year relationship
                with salacious model Amber Rose, the song blurs the line between fantasy and reality, sex and
                romance, love and religion, until no lines exist at all. It's a zonked nirvana with demons
                underneath; a fragile state that can't help but break apart on the very next song.</p>

            <p class="first">The haunted, Aphex Twin-sampling "Blame Game" bottoms out with a verse in
                which Kanye's voice is sped up, slowed down and stretched out. The effect is almost psychotic,
                suggesting three or four inner monologues fighting over smashed emotions. It's one of many
                moments on the record where West manipulates his vocals. Whether funneling some of his
                best-ever rhymes through a tinny, Strokes-like filter on "Gorgeous" or making himself
                wail like a dying cyborg in the final minutes of "Runaway", he uses studio wizardry to
                draw out his multitudes. Tellingly, though, he doesn't get the last word on the album.
                That distinction goes to the sobering tones of Gil Scott-Heron's 1970 spoken-word piece
                "Comment #1", a stark take on the American fable. "All I want is a good home and a wife
                and children and some food to feed them every night," says Scott-Heron, bringing the fantasy to a close.</p>

            <p class="first">On "POWER", Kanye raps, "My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty is
                honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts/ Reality is catching up with me, taking
                my inner child, I'm fighting for custody." The lines nail another commonality between
                the rapper and his hero. Like Michael, Kanye's behavior-- from the poorly planned outbursts
                to the musical brilliance-- is wide-eyed in a way that most 33 year olds have long left
                behind. That naivety is routinely battered on Twisted Fantasy, yet it survives, better
                for the wear. With his music and persona both marked by a flawed honesty, Kanye's man-myth
                dichotomy is at once modern and truly classic. "I can't be everybody's hero and villain,
                savior and sinner, Christian and anti Christ!" he wrote earlier this month. That may be true,
                but he's more willing than anyone else to try.</p>

            <h2><em>True Sadness</em> - The Avett Brothers</h2>
            <h4 class="credit">-- Pitchfork Scores it <span class="score">3.8/10</span></h4>
            <h3>It’s fitting that the Avett Brothers’ most disappointing record yet bears the title of
                True Sadness. Is this some kind of play for the Top 40, or just instrumental bloat and trite sentiment?</h3>

            <p class="first">The Avett Brothers once seemed to hold an infinite amount of promise. They were a
                hardworking group of young men who traded in songs that were as poignant as they were ragged.
                The titular Avetts, the older Scott and younger Seth, wore their bleeding hearts on their sleeves,
                and they always came off as earnest, honest, regular fellas from North Carolina who were
                thoughtfully dedicated to their craft.</p>

            <p class="first">The band’s tide started to turn toward the big time in 2007 with the sparkling
                Emotionalism, and the subsequent I and Love and You found the band working with the famed
                Rick Rubin as their producer. But the band’s work with Rubin has yielded records scrubbed
                of the rawness and grit that made the band so compelling in its early years. It’s fitting,
                then, that The Avett Brothers’ most abysmal and disappointing record yet bears the title of
                True Sadness.</p>

            <p class="first">True Sadness is a record that can’t seem to get out of its own way. Almost every
                track is bloated with instrumentation. Several songs are smothered with baffling layers of
                synthesizers in what feels like a ploy to push the Avetts into clear Top 40 territory.
                They were never a bluegrass band, of course, and always existed in the interesting overlapping
                gray areas between folk, Americana, and rock circles. But the synths and electronic beats that
                burble up on “You Are Mine” and “Satan Pulls the Strings” don’t make sense for the band in any
                context. The shift isn’t even bold enough to warrant a “Dylan goes electric” comparison. Instead,
                it sounds like a half-baked bad idea that no one had the guts or sense to veto. The slathered-on
                saccharine arrangements sink to their most unfortunate low on closing track “May It Last,” which
                aims for elegance and intensity but instead comes through as a ham-fisted and embarrassing attempt
                at something serious.</p>

            <p class="first">Somewhere along the way, the Avetts lost a grip on their lyrical skills, too. True
                Sadness presents some astonishingly bad turns of phrase, as when Seth Avett sings about wishing
                to be “a tune you sang in your kitchen,” so that he “could float around your tongue and ease the
                tension.” Elsewhere, songs manage to be preachy and completely self-unaware, as the Avetts sing
                about being tempted by Satan, struggling with belief, and being victimized by the grand scheme of
                life itself. Losing love was once an occasion for collapsin’ and screamin’ at the moon, but the
                Avetts got all of that drama out of their system in 2008, it seems. Now, they offer the likes of
                the self-explanatory “Divorce Separation Blues,” which feels like a dopey “Oops, my bad” at
                best—goofy yodels don’t much help the song’s case for sympathy, either. Scott and Seth Avett sing
                about guilt and feeling bad, but these songs ring hollow. It’s as if the Avetts knew folks might
                expect heartfelt confessional material—especially in the wake of Seth’s slightly scandalous split
                from his wife—and wrote a clutch of songs that half-assedly check the box.</p>

            <p class="first">The band does find itself making one short breakthrough with “Fisher Road to
                Hollywood,” an intimate track that feels like being snapped from a bad dream. The song,
                buried on the back half of the record, is almost a sincere mea culpa, an admission of
                regret for the way that things went seriously wrong for the band as a unit and as individuals.
                The band returns to its early strong suit: Gentle acoustic strums, mournful cello, plaintive
                vocals. There’s the sense that all hope isn’t lost for the Avett Brothers, that maybe they
                could scrap all of the messy baggage they’ve acquired in their rise from grimy clubs to sold-out
                arenas and major label dealings. But then, those four-and-a-half minutes are over, and you’re
                forced to reckon with the empty misery of True Sadness once again.</p>

            <h2><em>Igor</em> - Tyler, the Creator</h2>
            <h4 class="credit">-- Pitchfork Scores it <span class="score">8/10</span></h4>
            <h3>Tyler, the Creator’s sixth album is impressionistic and emotionally charged,
                the result of an auteur refining his style and baring more of his soul than ever before.</h3>

            <p class="first">The moods of Tyler, the Creator’s albums have largely been defined by
                absence—of his father, of critical acclaim, of love. He responded to what was missing
                with antagonism, album after album, until 2017 when he looked back at his life with a
                sunny lens and twinge of nostalgia to deliver his best work, Flower Boy. That Grammy-nominated
                album is eminently pleasing, the sound of an iconoclast succumbing to his better judgment. IGOR,
                the 28-year-old’s sixth full-length, is Tyler finally content in the face of all that agony.</p>

            <p class="first">IGOR sounds like the work of a perfectionist giving shape to his more radical ideas.
                Tyler, who proudly produced, wrote, and arranged the album, is singing more but he’s not worrying
                whether his tracks have a traditional pop arc. Songs don’t build to a crescendo, they often begin
                there. The opening “IGOR’S THEME” serves less as a guiding force and more like a recurring motif
                of doom that hides in the shadows and pops its head in at select moments, like on “NEW MAGIC WAND”
                where spooky synths erupt below Tyler’s thought process: “I saw a photo, you looked joyous,” goes
                one of the more poignant lines. Atop this budding dread, Tyler layers candied keys and harmonizing
                vocals. The brightness is defiant, as Tyler processes the loss of someone he loves.</p>

            <p class="first">The first we hear of Tyler’s vanishing relationship is on “EARFQUAKE”: “Don’t leave,
                it’s my fault.” First pitched-up and later untreated, Tyler’s voice is pleading but not cloying.
                He doesn’t sound like he’s lying to quickly repair deep damage, as his words may suggest, he’s
                just being sincere. IGOR becomes a gracious and giving breakup album whose narrative is fleshed
                out more clearly later in the record: Tyler seems to have fallen for a man (“You’re my favorite
                garçon,” he sings at one point) who wants to return to his female partner. “I hope you know she
                can’t compete with me,” he first sings on “GONE, GONE / THANK YOU,” before shifting his tone:
                “Thank you for the love/Thank you for the joy.”</p>

            <p class="first">As the album progresses, Tyler goes through his undulations of denial and acceptance,
                but spends considerable energy hoping to help his beloved find satisfaction, even if that means a
                future without him. “Take your mask off,” he advises on “RUNNING OUT OF TIME,” “Stop lyin’ to
                yourself, I know the real you.” It’s an empathetic turn from an artist previously allergic to
                other people’s perspectives. The parting ultimately leads to self-discovery: “You never lived
                in your truth,” he tells his ex. “But I finally found peace, so peace.”</p>

            <p class="first">There’s a run at IGOR’s center where each song’s momentum seems to propel him
                forward emotionally. It’s during this stretch that Tyler is at his most creatively fluid, as
                on “A BOY IS A GUN*,” where he flattens his voice to sing “gun,” sounding like a laser cutting
                across the track and maybe also through his own psyche. Combined with the Kanye-assisted
                “PUPPET,” these tracks in their varied tone and tempo reflect the volatility of Tyler’s
                emotions across IGOR. Most songs don’t even have a natural ending, they just snap off,
                like someone pulled the aux cord abruptly.</p>

            <p class="first">IGOR may be unsettled but it never feels restless. As Tyler grapples with
                uncertainty and unfulfillment, he delivers an album that feels like it is suspended in midair.
                It reminds me of Solange’s When I Get Home or King Krule’s The OOZ, albums that succeed in
                communicating mood as their own sense of logic. Tyler’s interpretation of this sort of
                stream-of-consciousness feels weightless. The whole album is sustained by mutating,
                colorful chords, impressionistic cracks in tonality. On top of that, Tyler’s synthetic
                falsetto singing adds a surreal element to IGOR. The lines between desire and reality
                and internal monologue and human conversation all become blurred.</p>

            <p class="first">Tyler, the Creator never shied away from sharing what he thought his life
                was missing. “I ain’t got no fucking money,” he yelled simply enough on the inimitable
                “Radicals,” an early Odd Future anthem. And when he got what he thought he wanted, he
                flaunted it: “Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs,” he taunted his
                father on “Answer.” IGOR is the first time Tyler has not been motivated by some absence
                because he lost a bit of himself in someone else. “ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?,” the album’s
                rough and honeyed send-off, is Tyler’s final attempt at salvaging his relationship. He’s
                finally without his beau and asks for the compromise of friendship. The track, as with
                many on IGOR, ends sharply with a synth never resolving its buzz. There’s nothing left to
                say when you’ve given all of yourself away.</p>

            <h2><em>Dicaprio 2</em> - J.I.D</h2>
            <h4 class="credit">-- Pitchfork Scores it <span class="score">7.7/10</span></h4>
            <h3>The East Atlanta rapper’s second album doesn't try to take on the world and is all the
                better for it, showing that J.I.D. has much more to offer than his formidable rapping chops.</h3>

            <p class="first">Four tracks into DiCaprio 2, J. Cole, shows up for a feature. Typically,
                on these sort of master-student collaborations, the less-experienced rapper’s strain is
                audible as he attempts to show he can hang. Here, it’s the opposite: J.I.D’s opening verse
                is so gleeful, so effortless and so fast, that when it comes Cole’s turn to rap, you can
                almost hear him brace for impact. Cole gets off a strong verse, and the song, “Off Deez,”
                is one of many standouts here. But you can just imagine them stepping out of booth, J.I.D
                pumped and ready for more; Cole relieved that he can still rap as well as his younger signee.</p>

            <p class="first">J.I.D’s confidence comes from years of work. Finally starting to get his due
                at the age of 28, Destin Route built up a head of steam in the old-fashioned way (circa 2007,
                or B.I.G., Before Instagram), releasing mixtape after mixtape until he turned heads with the
                first DiCaprio project, an EP released at the top of 2015. He signed with Cole’s label,
                Dreamville, in 2017 and his debut album, The Never Story, was released in March and converted
                rap fans all year mostly off the strength of the rapper’s technical ability and the delight
                that he takes in displaying it. That ability has been refined further on DiCaprio 2, but
                J.I.D’s second album has more to offer than simple rapping chops.</p>

            <p class="first">Let’s talk about those for a second though. J.I.D’s hyper-enunciated,
                high-pitched whine of a flow is initially reminiscent of Kendrick Lamar’s, but that
                comparison feels narrow. (He plays with the connection explicitly on “Despacito Too,”
                interpolating Kendrick lyrics in a narrative about his own individual development.)
                J.I.D’s melodic instincts are strong, sharing ties with Isaiah Rashad and even,
                occasionally, Bone Thugs, and he has the ability to get jokes off even in the midst
                of triple-time rapping, a la Big L or Lil Wayne. Though he can rap faster than almost
                any newcomer in recent memory, he uses the speed as one of several tools and his flow is
                chameleonic, suited to the given moment. (His pen name comes from his grandma’s chosen
                adjective for him, “jittery,” and it’s the right word for this restless rapper.)</p>

            <p class="first">And then, of course, there are little lyrical gems. The best lines here
                feel like J.I.D is performing acrobatics on a 20-foot tightrope; many of his lyrics
                operate on the basis of his speed jousting with listener's expectations and making his
                songs surprising and relistenable. A bizarre line zips by in “Westbrook,” an A$AP Ferg
                feature, “Live life like a baby that was dead at birth but came alive and fucked the
                nurses,” the deadpan absurdity hitting your ears so quickly that you want to hear it
                again, just to confirm that he really said it. He also makes great use of little
                switchbacks; on “Off Da Zoinkys,” an anti-drug anthem, he thanks Ronald Reagan
                (ostensibly for the War on Drugs) and as you’re gearing up to react, he immediately
                takes it back, calling the 40th president “racist as fuck.”</p>

            <p class="first">“Off Da Zoinky’s” gives a window into J.I.D’s appeal. Given that it’s an
                anti-drug sermon of sorts, it could easily have been sanctimonious. Instead, it’s
                self-aware (“I ain’t nosy but I know what I know, Mr. Know-It-All, oh here he go”)
                and it builds over time. J.I.D. eventually says that the reason he stays drug-free
                is that he wants his mind clear and his focus sharp because he’s trying to be the
                greatest. That higher purpose gives the song more in common with Andre 3000 on
                “ATLiens” (”No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day”) than with
                J. Cole’s album-long campaign against sin, KOD.</p>

            <p class="first">DiCaprio 2’s lyrical showcase takes a turn on “Workin’ Out,” and
                across the remainder of the album, J.I.D tries different things, usually successfully.
                (The clear exception is “Skrawberries,” a thick-headed treatise on gender relations that
                wastes a Mac Miller beat and comes complete with the line “[she] got a couple abortions,
                now that pussy’s a haunted house.”) “Tiiied,” a song about relationship drama, opens on
                J.I.D fighting with his girl at the movies sounding a little like Anderson .Paak with a
                fine eye for detail. The song is produced by Dreamville’s Elite and Ron Gilmore and it’s
                filled with jazzy musical flourishes that, like many of the beats here, catch your ear
                anew once you’ve become familiar with the verses. But the strongest song on the album’s
                back half is “Hot Box,” as J.I.D works out his New York fetishism with a head-turning
                guest verse from Method Man and some lovely neo-boom bap courtesy of Skhye Hutch
                (who’s produced for Ab-Soul and Kendrick) and Zorro.</p>

            <p class="first">J.I.D’s presence on Dreamville makes all kinds of sense. He shares
                Cole’s values and the priorities and pleasures of his music are those of an older
                generation. On the late-album standout “Just Da Other Day,” he says “I’m tryna get
                my fuckin goals, not a goyard,” and his anti-materialist outlook and low-key contempt
                for his contemporaries tracks perfectly with his label boss. But nothing about J.I.D
                is crochety or bitter. His songs are about joy and hunger and reflection and fun. Not
                one of them feels as if it’s trying to save hip-hop.</p>

            <h2><em>Wincing the Night Away</em> - The Shins</h2>
            <h4 class="credit">-- Pitchfork Scores it <span class="score">7/10</span></h4>
            <h3>James Mercer & co. aim to deflect the inevitable Brafflash by crafting a more
                texturally diverse record than their outstanding, if uncomplicated, previous outings.</h3>

            <p class="first">While indie rock has embraced grander and more elaborate productions,
                the Shins have remained unlikely champions of uncertainty and understatement. Unlike
                many of their meteorically successful indie peers, the Shins don't want to change your
                life-- and that's a good thing, because the band's biggest strength is an uncanny gift
                for conjuring a deep, vivid, and palpable sense of the familiar. Many of the Shins' best
                songs evoke a feeling of comfort and closeness that's immediately recognizable but rarely
                experienced-- intimacy is the band's best weapon, amplifying the subtle ebbs and flows of
                their music so that the slightest injection of unease or melancholy hits with remarkable force.</p>

            <p class="first">On their third Sub Pop full-length, Wincing the Night Away, the Shins take a
                decisive but wobbly step out of their comfort zone, and in doing so sacrifice much of this
                musical/emotional proximity effect. While the band has taken a good deal of criticism for
                sounding "too average" or "boring," the ill-suited sonic punch of Wincing the Night Away
                throws the singular strengths of their previous work into stark relief. The almost-live
                sounding Chutes Too Narrow left plenty of room for singer James Mercer's excellent vocals
                to guide its songs both melodically and rhythmically. But on Wincing, too-loud drums and
                bass distract not only from the elegant movement of Mercer's melodies, but from the delicate
                harmonic tensions that underlie them.</p>

            <p class="first">That said, the first four tracks of Wincing are unerringly solid. Echoing the
                striking contrast of Chutes Too Narrow opener "Kissing the Lipless", Wincing's lead track,
                "Sleeping Lessons", builds from sparse, muffled arpeggios to full-on rock'n'roll. While slick
                and robust production doesn't flatter much of the record, it works well as a counterpoint
                to the song's quiet initial moments. "Australia" is a peppy rocker in the spirit of Chutes'
                best, elevated by a newfound confidence and expressive range in Mercer's voice. Single
                "Phantom Limb" is pure, lush pop, boasting a chorus that plays like the aural equivalent
                of that optical illusion where a staircase appears to ascend indefinitely.</p>

            <p class="first">With the exception of the excellent "Red Rabbits", the more noticeable aesthetic
                departures on Wincing don't fare as well. "Sea Legs", with its intrusive synthesized drum beat
                and lackluster arrangement, brings to mind that unfortunate Eve 6 song about putting your heart
                in a blender, while "Spilt Needles" comes off as sterile and overcalculated, despite its strong
                chorus. Still, the album finishes strong: "Girl Sailor" surpasses "Phantom Limb" in lyrics and
                overall structure, making it a likely contender for the album's second single, and "A Comet
                Appears" is beautifully orchestrated, if not terribly memorable, making it an appropriate
                closer for a record that often emphasizes texture over form.</p>

            <p class="first">There's a time-honored imperative to encourage bands for attempting to develop
                and expand, and the Shins could certainly take their music in many different directions with
                great success. But it's hard not to notice that the least adventurous tracks on Wincing the
                Night Away are generally the most rewarding. In many cases, the album's more experimental
                touches seem at odds with the natural elegance of Mercer's songwriting, making it hard to
                read the album as a shoddy blueprint of what a more "difficult" Shins record might sound
                like. Instead, Wincing the Night Away is a lovely and well-executed album and-- for the
                first time in the band's career-- nothing more.</p>
